"In the desert, Paul and Jessica encounter the Fremen, Arrakis's native inhabitants, who have adapted to the harsh desert conditions. Paul is revealed to have extraordinary abilities, partly because of his Bene Gesserit training (a secretive sisterhood to which Jessica belongs) and partly due to the influence of spice. The Fremen see him as a prophesied messiah who will lead them to freedom","{

"Dune explores themes such as politics, religion, and ecology. The struggle for control of spice reflects the real-world conflict over natural resources. The novel also delves into the idea of prophecy and destiny, as Paul grapples with his foreseen path and the moral implications of his actions. Frank Herbert's creation offers a complex view of power, with the desert planet of Arrakis serving as a central character in its own right, shaping the destiny of all who come into contact with it","{
